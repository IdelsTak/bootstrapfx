  description: 'BootstrapFX: CSS and widgets'
  longDescription: |
    BootstrapFX is a partial port of [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) for JavaFX. It mainly provides a CSS
    stylesheet that closely resembles the original while being custom tailored for JavaFX's unique CSS flavor.

    It's worth mentioning that Twitter Bootstrap delivers more than just a standardized look for common widgets. It also
    provides new widgets, behavior and a grid system. Some of these features may be ported at a later stage to BootstrapFX.
